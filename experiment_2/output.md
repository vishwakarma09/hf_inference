Here is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:

```
1. Use the `web_search` tool to find the maximum speed a cheetah can achieve.
2. Use the `web_search` tool to find the length of Pont Alexandre III.
3. Convert the cheetah's speed to a consistent unit (e.g., meters per second).
4. Convert the length of Pont Alexandre III to the same unit (e.g., meters).
5. Calculate the time it would take for the cheetah to run the length of Pont Alexandre III using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.
6. Use the `final_answer` tool to provide the final answer to the problem.
